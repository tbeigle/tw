Change WooCommerce variations into radio buttons and adds descriptions to variations.

== Description ==

This is a simple and light-weight plugin that once installed and activated will convert your Woocommerce variations from a drop down menu to radio buttons.  Allow your consumers to see all of your variations without having to access your drop down menu.

It also adds a "Variation Description" field. You fill the field in the backend, and it will show on the frontend on the product page.

It stops the forced display of "SKU". The SKU for variable products will only be displayed if you enter a SKU.

See the [documentation](http://isabelcastillo.com/docs/category/woocommerce-variation-description-radio-buttons)

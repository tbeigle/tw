WooCommerce Variation Description Radio Buttons
===============================================

Change WooCommerce variations into radio buttons and adds descriptions to variations.

This is a simple and light-weight plugin that once installed and activated will convert your Woocommerce variations from a drop down menu to radio buttons.  Allow your consumers to see all of your variations without having to access your drop down menu.

It also adds a "Variation Description" field. You fill the field in the backend, and it will show on the frontend on the product page.

It stops the forced display of "SKU: N/A". The SKU for the variable products will only be displayed if you enter a SKU. (WooCommerce default behavior is to show "SKU: N/A" if you don't enter a SKU for variable products.)
